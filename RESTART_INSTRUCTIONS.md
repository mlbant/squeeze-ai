# ðŸ”„ IMPORTANT: Restart Required

## âœ… Environment Variables Are Configured Correctly

Your `.env` file has the correct Stripe keys:
- âœ… Stripe key: `sk_live_51RkvPvGRjwg...`
- âœ… Admin username: `squeeze_admin`
- âœ… Secret key: `QaG8EaYfI12u1vb7fyPX...`

## ðŸš¨ Action Required: Restart Your App

The error you're seeing is because your Streamlit app is still running with old environment variables. You need to **restart the application** to pick up the new Stripe keys.

### How to Restart:

#### If running locally:
1. **Stop the current app**: Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal
2. **Restart the app**: Run `streamlit run app.py` again

#### If using deploy.bat:
1. **Stop the current process**: Press `Ctrl+C` 
2. **Run deploy script again**: `.\deploy.bat`
3. **Choose option 4**: Run application locally

#### If using Docker:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### If deployed to Streamlit Cloud:
1. Go to your Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Click "Reboot app" or redeploy

## ðŸ§ª Test After Restart

After restarting, the debugging message should disappear and the Stripe payment buttons should work properly.

## âœ… What Should Happen

Once restarted:
- âœ… No more "Stripe API key not configured" error
- âœ… "Upgrade to Pro" buttons will create real Stripe checkout sessions
- âœ… Payment processing will work with your live Stripe account

## ðŸŽ¯ Your App is Ready!

After this restart, your Squeeze AI app will be **100% production-ready** with:
- Live Stripe payment processing
- Real user tracking
- Secure authentication
- Professional features

**Just restart the app and you're ready to launch! ðŸš€**
