- **Created**: `.env.example` with placeholder values

### 2. **Removed User Data**

- **Created**: `config.yaml.example` as template

### 3. **Removed Database with User Data**

- **Created**: `init_db.py` to initialize clean database on deployment

### 4. **Removed User History Files**
- **Deleted**: `*_history.csv` files
- **Deleted**: `guest_*.txt` files

### 5. **Updated .gitignore**
- ‚úÖ Already had proper `.gitignore` file

## üöÄ Your Repository is Now Safe

Your files are now clean and safe to upload to GitHub:
- ‚ùå **No API keys** exposed
- ‚ùå **No user data** included
- ‚ùå **No passwords** in files
- ‚úÖ **Only code and configuration templates**

## üîë Your API Keys (Keep These Safe!)

When you deploy, you'll need these keys. **DO NOT put them in files**:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[your_stripe_secret_key_here]
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[your_stripe_publishable_key_here]
ADMIN_USERNAME=squeeze_admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=[your_hashed_admin_password]
SECRET_KEY=[your_secret_key_here]
SENDER_EMAIL=[your_email@gmail.com]
SENDER_APP_PASSWORD=[your_gmail_app_password]
```

**Note**: The actual keys have been removed from this file for security.

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub**: Your files are now safe to upload
2. **Deploy to Railway**: Add the API keys above in Railway's Variables section
3. **Test**: Your app will work the same as before

## üõ°Ô∏è What This Means

- **GitHub won't flag**: No more security warnings
- **Keys are safe**: API keys only exist in hosting platform
- **Still works**: Your app functionality is unchanged
- **Production ready**: Safe for public deployment

You can now safely follow the **BEGINNER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** without any security issues!
