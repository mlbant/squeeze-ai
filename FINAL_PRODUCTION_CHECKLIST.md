## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps (Required for Launch)

### 1. **Configure Environment Variables** (CRITICAL)
Update your `.env` file with real production credentials:

```bash
# Get from Stripe Dashboard (stripe.com)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_stripe_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_webhook_secret

# Get from x.ai
XAI_API_KEY=xai-your_actual_xai_key

# Your production email for password resets
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_production_email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password

# Generate secure admin credentials
ADMIN_USERNAME=your_secure_admin_username
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_hashed_password

# Generate new secret key
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key_here
```

### 2. **Generate Secure Credentials**
Run these commands to generate secure values:

```python
# Generate secret key
python -c "import secrets; print('SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"

# Generate hashed admin password
python -c "import bcrypt; print('ADMIN_PASSWORD=' + bcrypt.hashpw('your_password'.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=12)).decode('utf-8'))"
```

### 3. **Choose Your Deployment Method**

#### Option A: Quick Local Test (Windows)
```bash
# Run the deployment script
.\deploy.bat
# Choose option 6 for full setup, then option 4 to run
```

#### Option B: Streamlit Cloud (Easiest for Production)
1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Go to share.streamlit.io
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Add environment variables in Streamlit Cloud settings
5. Deploy automatically

#### Option C: Docker Deployment
```bash
# With proper .env configuration
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Option D: VPS/Cloud Server
- Use the provided Nginx configuration
- Set up SSL certificates
- Deploy with Docker or direct Python
